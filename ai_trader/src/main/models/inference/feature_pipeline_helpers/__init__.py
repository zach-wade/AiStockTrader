"""
Feature pipeline helpers for model inference.

This module provides helper components for integrating features into inference:
- FeatureCalculatorIntegrator: Integrates feature calculators with inference
- FeatureSetDefinition: Defines feature sets for models
- InferenceFeatureCache: Caches features for low-latency inference
- RealtimeDataBuffer: Buffers real-time data for feature calculation
