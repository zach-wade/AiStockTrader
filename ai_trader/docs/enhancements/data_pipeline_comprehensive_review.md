## Batch Reviews

### Batch 1: Core Backfill Infrastructure
**Files**: `__init__.py`, `backfill/__init__.py`, `backfill_processor.py`, `orchestrator.py`, `progress_tracker.py`

#### 1. Refactoring Needs

**`__init__.py`**
- Clean and minimal, properly exports types and core components
- ✅ No refactoring needed

**`backfill/__init__.py`**
- Has commented out imports to avoid circular dependencies
- 🔧 **Need**: Resolve circular dependency issues with orchestrator components

**`backfill_processor.py`**
- Large class with 337 lines handling multiple responsibilities
- Mixed concerns: batch processing, result tracking, progress reporting, error handling
- 🔧 **Need**: Split into smaller, focused classes (ResultTracker, BatchProcessor, ProgressReporter)

**`orchestrator.py`**
- Massive 829-line file with complex orchestration logic
- Handles too many responsibilities: tier management, bulk loading, rate limiting, progress tracking
- Hardcoded stage mappings and source configurations
- 🔧 **Need**: Extract components into separate modules (RateLimiter, StageProcessor, ResourceManager)

**`progress_tracker.py`**
- Well-structured with clear separation of concerns
- Good use of dataclasses for data models
- ✅ Minor refactoring: Could benefit from async file I/O operations

#### 2. Utils Integration Opportunities

**Common Patterns Found**:
- Custom logging setup instead of using `get_logger` from utils
- Manual datetime handling that could use `ensure_utc` from utils.core
- Custom chunking logic that duplicates `chunk_list` from utils
- Manual timer implementations instead of using `timer` context manager

**Specific Opportunities**:
- `backfill_processor.py`:
  - Line 17: Already uses `get_logger` ✅
  - Lines 64, 300: Manual datetime.utcnow() → use timezone-aware utils
  - Line 191-234: Custom batch processing → could use ProcessingUtils patterns
  
- `orchestrator.py`:
  - Line 31: Uses standard logging instead of `get_logger`
  - Line 26: Already imports `timer` and `chunk_list` from utils ✅
  - Lines 734-752: Manual rate limiting → could use utils.monitoring.RateLimiter
  - Lines 161-165: Custom API call tracking → integrate with MetricsCollector

- `progress_tracker.py`:
  - Lines 34, 108, 173: Manual datetime handling → use utils.core datetime utilities
  - Lines 166-171: Synchronous file I/O → could use async utils if available
