# Feature Pipeline and Models Unified Refactoring Analysis

## Overview
This document analyzes the feature_pipeline and models folders to identify opportunities for refactoring, consolidation, and removal of redundant code. The analysis includes examination of how these components interact with the config and utils folders.

## Analysis Approach
- Examine files in batches of 5-10
- Identify duplicated functionality
- Find opportunities for consolidation
- Note deprecated or unused code
- Recommend architectural improvements

## File Count Summary
- **feature_pipeline**: 90 Python files
