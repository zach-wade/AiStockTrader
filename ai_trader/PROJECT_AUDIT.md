## 🚨 Critical Findings

### Test Coverage Status - CORRECTED
- **156 test files found** in tests/ directory
- Test suite categories: fixtures (12), integration (54), monitoring (1), performance (4), unit (68), root tests (17)
- 53,957 lines of test code vs 231,721 lines of main code
- **23% test-to-code line ratio** (needs improvement to reach 80%+ industry standard)
- Test organization appears good with unit/integration/performance separation

### Major Code Smells
1. **Three empty modules**: core/, services/, migrations/
2. **Massive modules**: data_pipeline (40K lines), feature_pipeline (44K lines), utils (36K lines)
3. **10+ files over 500 lines** need refactoring
4. **Circular import patterns** detected in 5+ files
5. **No docstrings** in many files

### Architectural Issues
1. **events/** module likely deprecated (6,707 lines of dead code?)
2. **Duplicate functionality** suspected between modules
3. **No clear separation** between models/, features/, and feature_pipeline/
4. **Factory pattern inconsistency** across modules

## Critical Path Components

### 1. Data Flow Pipeline
```
Polygon/Alpaca API → Ingestion → Validation → Storage → Archive
                                      ↓
                              Hot (PostgreSQL) / Cold (Data Lake)
```
**Status**: 🟡 Partially Working  
**Issues**: Hot/cold routing not fully implemented

### 2. Trading Execution Flow
```
Market Data → Features → Models → Signals → Risk Checks → Execution
```
**Status**: 🟡 Needs Verification  
**Issues**: Model training unclear, scanner issues

### 3. Monitoring & Dashboards
```
System Dashboard + Trading Dashboard → Real-time Metrics
```
**Status**: 🔴 Issues Present  
**Issues**: System health tab empty, graceful shutdown broken

---

## Known Issues Summary

### Priority 2 - Performance & Quality (Medium)
1. Feature calculation delays
2. Database query slowness (>500ms)
3. API connection timeouts
4. ai_trader.py script too large, needs refactoring
5. Hot/cold storage routing incomplete

### Priority 3 - Code Quality (Low)
1. Deprecated event bus code needs removal
2. Models directory organization unclear
3. Duplicate factory patterns
4. Sentiment analysis in wrong dashboard
5. Documentation needs updates
