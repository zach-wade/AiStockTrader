## Critical Path Components

### 1. Data Flow Pipeline
```
Polygon/Alpaca API → Ingestion → Validation → Storage → Archive
                                      ↓
                              Hot (PostgreSQL) / Cold (Data Lake)
```
**Status**: 🟡 Partially Working  
**Issues**: Hot/cold routing not fully implemented

### 2. Trading Execution Flow
```
Market Data → Features → Models → Signals → Risk Checks → Execution
```
**Status**: 🟡 Needs Verification  
**Issues**: Model training unclear, scanner issues

### 3. Monitoring & Dashboards
```
System Dashboard + Trading Dashboard → Real-time Metrics
```
**Status**: 🔴 Issues Present  
**Issues**: System health tab empty, graceful shutdown broken

## Known Issues Summary

### Priority 0 - System Breaking (Must Fix)
1. Scheduled jobs are broken
2. Graceful shutdown not working
3. Scanner execution pipeline not integrated with main entry point

### Priority 1 - Major Functionality (High)
1. Scanners not working properly
2. System health dashboard tab empty
3. Dashboard doesn't exit cleanly on interrupt
4. Circuit breaker triggering inappropriately
5. Database execute operations need audit (see docs/reports/database_execute_audit.md)

### Priority 2 - Performance & Quality (Medium)
1. Feature calculation delays
2. Database query slowness (>500ms)
3. API connection timeouts
4. ai_trader.py script too large, needs refactoring
5. Hot/cold storage routing incomplete

### Priority 3 - Code Quality (Low)
1. Deprecated event bus code needs removal
2. Models directory organization unclear
3. Duplicate factory patterns
4. Sentiment analysis in wrong dashboard
5. Documentation needs updates
