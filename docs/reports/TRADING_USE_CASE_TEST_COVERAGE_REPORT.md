- ✅ Stop-limit order placement
- ✅ Portfolio not found error
- ✅ Market data unavailable error
- ✅ Validation failures (with and without error messages)
- ✅ Risk limit violations
- ✅ Broker submission failures
- ✅ All validation scenarios (invalid order type, side, quantity, missing prices)
- ✅ Edge cases with correlation IDs and metadata

### 2. CancelOrderUseCase

Complete coverage including:

- ✅ Successful cancellation with and without reason
- ✅ Order not found error
- ✅ Already filled order rejection
- ✅ Already cancelled order rejection
- ✅ Rejected order handling
- ✅ Broker failure scenarios
- ✅ Broker exceptions
- ✅ Validation for missing order ID

### 3. ModifyOrderUseCase

Complete coverage including:

- ✅ Quantity modification
- ✅ Limit price modification
- ✅ Stop price modification
- ✅ Multiple field modifications
- ✅ All fields modification
- ✅ Order not found error
- ✅ Validation failures (with and without error messages)
- ✅ Broker failures and exceptions
- ✅ All validation scenarios (missing ID, no modifications, zero/negative quantities)

### 4. GetOrderStatusUseCase

Complete coverage including:

- ✅ Successful status retrieval with fills
- ✅ Status retrieval without fills
- ✅ Status updates from broker
- ✅ No update when status unchanged
- ✅ Broker returns None handling
- ✅ Order not found error
- ✅ Broker failure with cached data fallback
- ✅ Validation for missing order ID

## Request/Response DTOs Tested

- ✅ PlaceOrderRequest (with defaults and custom values)
- ✅ CancelOrderRequest (with defaults and custom values)
- ✅ ModifyOrderRequest (with defaults and custom values)
- ✅ GetOrderStatusRequest (with defaults and custom values)

## Test Categories

### Success Scenarios ✅

- All happy path flows for each use case
- Various order types and configurations
- Proper transaction handling

### Error Handling ✅

- Portfolio not found
- Order not found
- Market data unavailable
- Validation failures
- Risk limit violations
- Broker failures and exceptions
- Invalid order states

### Edge Cases ✅

- Zero values
- None values
- Empty data
- Correlation ID tracking
- Strategy metadata
- Request ID handling
- All validation branches

### Mocking Strategy

All external dependencies properly mocked:

- Unit of Work (portfolios, orders, market_data repositories)
- Broker interface
- Order validator
- Risk calculator
- Market data bars

## Key Achievements

1. **100% Statement Coverage**: Every line of code is executed
2. **100% Branch Coverage**: All conditional paths tested
3. **Comprehensive Error Testing**: All error scenarios covered
4. **Edge Case Coverage**: Boundary conditions and special cases tested
5. **Clean Test Structure**: Well-organized test classes with proper fixtures
6. **Realistic Mocking**: Accurate simulation of dependencies

## Test Execution

```bash
# Run tests with coverage report
python -m pytest tests/unit/application/use_cases/test_trading.py \
    --cov=src.application.use_cases.trading \
    --cov-report=term-missing \
    -v

# Results: 63 passed in ~5 seconds
# Coverage: 100%
```

## Notes

- All tests follow async patterns correctly
- Proper use of fixtures for reusable mocks
- Comprehensive assertion coverage
- Tests validate both success and error response structures
- Edge cases include correlation IDs and metadata handling
