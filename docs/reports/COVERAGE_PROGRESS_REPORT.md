## Coverage Analysis by Component

### Domain Layer (Critical for 80% target)

#### Entities (Current: ~50% average)

- `order.py`: 64.04% ✅ (Good coverage)
- `portfolio.py`: 35.97% ❌ (Needs comprehensive tests)
- `position.py`: 53.21% ⚠️ (Needs improvement)

#### Value Objects (Current: ~30% average)

- `base.py`: 38.10% ❌ (Tests created, needs execution fix)
- `money.py`: 27.83% ❌ (Has tests, needs enhancement)
- `price.py`: 27.27% ❌ (Has tests, needs enhancement)
- `quantity.py`: Covered by existing tests

#### Domain Services (Current: ~25% average)

- NEW services tested but implementation not being executed:
  - `trading_validation_service.py`: 16.28% ❌
  - `market_hours_service.py`: 26.40% ❌
  - `threshold_policy_service.py`: 29.38% ❌
- Other services need tests:
  - `position_manager.py`: 6.59% ❌
  - `risk_calculator.py`: 9.93% ❌
  - `trading_calendar.py`: 19.31% ❌

### Application Layer (Current: ~40% average)

#### Config & Coordinators

- `config.py`: 91.43% ✅ (Excellent coverage)
- `config_loader.py`: Has tests (1 failing test to fix)
- `service_factory.py`: 88.99% ✅ (Good coverage)

#### Use Cases (Current: ~38% average)

- All use cases have basic tests but need enhancement:
  - `market_simulation.py`: 27.50% ❌
  - `portfolio.py`: 35.08% ❌
  - `order_execution.py`: 46.35% ⚠️
  - `risk.py`: 39.53% ❌
  - `trading.py`: 39.13% ❌

## Issues Encountered

1. **Import Errors**: Several comprehensive test files had import errors due to missing exception classes in interfaces
2. **Test Execution**: Some new tests created are not properly executing against the implementation
3. **Mocking Issues**: Time-based tests need proper mocking setup

## Recommendations to Reach 80% Coverage

### Immediate Actions (High Impact)

1. **Fix Test Execution Issues**
   - Resolve import errors in comprehensive test files
   - Ensure new domain service tests properly test the implementation
   - Fix the failing config_loader test

2. **Enhance Existing Domain Tests**
   - Complete portfolio entity tests (currently 35.97%)
   - Enhance position entity tests (currently 53.21%)
   - Add missing value object operation tests

3. **Create Missing Domain Service Tests**
   - Complete tests for position_manager (6.59%)
   - Complete tests for risk_calculator (9.93%)
   - Enhance trading_calendar tests (19.31%)

### Strategic Approach

1. Focus on domain layer first (core business logic)
2. Then enhance application use case tests
3. Infrastructure can be deprioritized as it's less critical

### Estimated Coverage Gains

- Fixing domain services tests: +15-20%
- Completing entity tests: +10-15%
- Enhancing use case tests: +15-20%
- **Total Potential**: +40-55% (reaching 65-80% coverage)

## Test Files Created

1. `/tests/unit/domain/services/test_trading_validation_service.py` (420 lines)
2. `/tests/unit/domain/services/test_market_hours_service.py` (620 lines)
3. `/tests/unit/domain/services/test_threshold_policy_service.py` (430 lines)
4. `/tests/unit/domain/value_objects/test_value_object_base.py` (500 lines)

## Next Steps

1. Fix import and execution issues with existing tests
2. Create comprehensive tests for portfolio and position entities
3. Enhance domain service test coverage
4. Run full test suite to verify 80% coverage achievement
