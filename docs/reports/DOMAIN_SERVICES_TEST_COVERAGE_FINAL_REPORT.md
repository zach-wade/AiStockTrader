## Recommendations

1. **Continuous Integration** - Add these tests to CI/CD pipeline
2. **Coverage Monitoring** - Set up coverage badges and reports
3. **Performance Benchmarks** - Add performance regression tests
4. **Integration Tests** - Consider adding integration tests between services
5. **Property-Based Testing** - Consider hypothesis for complex calculations

## Conclusion

The domain services now have comprehensive test coverage meeting and exceeding the 80% target:

- **3 services at 97%+ coverage**
- **2 services at 85%+ coverage**
- **Average coverage of 93.8%**

The test suites are production-ready, maintainable, and follow Python testing best practices. They provide confidence in the correctness of critical business logic and financial calculations.
