# Application Use Cases Test Coverage Report

## Summary

Comprehensive unit tests have been created and enhanced for the application use cases to improve overall test coverage.

## Current Coverage Status

### Use Case Module Coverage

| Module | Coverage | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|
| base.py | 100% | ✅ Complete |
| market_data.py | 89.71% | ✅ Good |
| market_simulation.py | 21.88% | ⚠️ Needs work |
| order_execution.py | 40.10% | ⚠️ Needs work |
| portfolio.py | 35.08% | ⚠️ Needs work |
| risk.py | 39.53% | ⚠️ Needs work |
| trading.py | 30.10% | ⚠️ Needs work |

### Overall Project Status

- **Current Overall Coverage**: ~23%
- **Target Coverage**: 80%
- **Gap**: 57%

## Work Completed

### 1. Base Use Case Tests (`test_base.py`)

Created comprehensive test suite with 26 test cases covering:

- ✅ UseCaseRequest initialization and defaults
- ✅ UseCaseResponse success/error factory methods
- ✅ UseCase execution flow with validation
- ✅ Error handling and logging
- ✅ TransactionalUseCase with commit/rollback
- ✅ Edge cases (missing request_id, exceptions)

### 2. Market Data Tests (Enhanced)

Fixed and improved existing tests:

- ✅ Fixed provider integration tests
- ✅ Corrected mock expectations
- ✅ Added proper error handling tests

## Test Files Created/Modified

### New Files

- `/tests/unit/application/use_cases/test_base.py` - 492 lines, 26 test cases

### Modified Files

- `/tests/unit/application/use_cases/test_market_data.py` - Fixed provider tests

## Identified Issues

### 1. Implementation Bug in GetLatestPriceUseCase

- **Issue**: When provider returns None for current_price, the code attempts to create a Bar with None values
- **Location**: `src/application/use_cases/market_data.py` lines 209-226
- **Impact**: Causes TypeError instead of proper error response
- **Fix Needed**: Add null check before creating Bar

### 2. Missing Test Coverage Areas

The following use cases need comprehensive tests:

- **market_simulation.py**: Needs tests for order triggering logic
- **order_execution.py**: Needs tests for fill processing and commission calculation
- **portfolio.py**: Needs tests for position management
- **risk.py**: Needs tests for risk calculations
- **trading.py**: Needs tests for order placement and management

## Recommendations to Achieve 80% Coverage

### Priority 1: High-Impact Modules (Quick Wins)

1. **Infrastructure Modules** (currently 0% coverage)
   - Add basic tests for database adapters
   - Test repository implementations
   - Mock external dependencies

2. **Domain Services** (partial coverage)
   - Complete test coverage for critical services
   - Focus on business logic validation

### Priority 2: Use Case Completion

Complete test coverage for remaining use cases:

- Focus on happy path scenarios first
- Add error cases and edge conditions
- Mock all external dependencies

### Priority 3: Integration Tests

- Add integration tests for complete workflows
- Test database transactions
- Verify broker integrations

## Test Patterns Established

### Standard Test Structure

```python
class TestUseCaseName:
    @pytest.fixture
    def mock_unit_of_work(self):
        # Setup mock UoW

    @pytest.fixture
    def use_case(self, mock_unit_of_work):
        # Create use case instance

    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    async def test_success_scenario(self):
        # Test happy path

    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    async def test_validation_error(self):
        # Test validation failures

    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    async def test_error_handling(self):
        # Test exception handling
```

### Mocking Best Practices

- Use AsyncMock for async methods
- Setup proper return values for repository methods
- Verify method calls with assert_called_once_with()
- Mock external services (brokers, market data providers)

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (to reach 40% coverage)

1. Fix the GetLatestPriceUseCase bug
2. Complete tests for order_execution.py
3. Complete tests for portfolio.py
4. Add basic infrastructure tests

### Medium-term Actions (to reach 60% coverage)

1. Complete tests for risk.py
2. Complete tests for trading.py
3. Add domain service tests
4. Add repository tests

### Long-term Actions (to reach 80% coverage)

1. Complete market_simulation.py tests
2. Add infrastructure resilience tests
3. Add security module tests
4. Add monitoring module tests

## Testing Commands

### Run All Use Case Tests

```bash
python -m pytest tests/unit/application/use_cases/ -v
```

### Check Use Case Coverage

```bash
python -m pytest tests/unit/application/use_cases/ \
    --cov=src/application/use_cases \
    --cov-report=term-missing
```

### Check Overall Coverage

```bash
python -m pytest tests/unit \
    --cov=src \
    --cov-report=html
```

## Conclusion

Significant progress has been made on the application use case test coverage:

- Base use case functionality now has 100% coverage
- Market data use cases have 89.71% coverage
- Test patterns and fixtures are established for remaining work

To achieve the 80% overall coverage target, focus should shift to:

1. Completing remaining use case tests
2. Adding infrastructure layer tests
3. Testing domain services and entities

The foundation is now in place for rapid test development across the remaining modules.
