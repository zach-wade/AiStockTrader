# Test Status Report

Last Updated: December 13, 2024

## Overview

This document tracks the current state of all tests in the AI Stock Trader system. Tests are categorized by criticality and current stability.

## Test Categories

### 🚨 Critical Tests (Must Pass)

Tests that validate core functionality required for paper trading. CI will fail if these don't pass.

| Test Suite | Status | Pass Rate | Notes |
|------------|--------|-----------|-------|
| Smoke Tests | ✅ PASSING | 10/10 (100%) | Core paper trading validation |
| Critical Imports | ✅ PASSING | 100% | Domain entities, value objects, paper broker |
| Paper Trading Integration | ✅ PASSING | 100% | Basic order execution |

### 🟡 Important Tests (Should Pass)

Tests for stable features that should work but aren't blocking.

| Test Suite | Status | Pass Rate | Notes |
|------------|--------|-----------|-------|
| Value Objects | ✅ MOSTLY PASSING | 286/289 (98.6%) | 3 known comparison issues |
| Domain Entities | ✅ MOSTLY PASSING | 54/57 (94.7%) | Portfolio thread safety pending |
| Order Validator | ✅ PASSING | 100% | Order validation logic |
| Position Manager | ⚠️ PARTIAL | ~85% | Async tests skipped |

### 🔴 Failing Tests (Need Fixing)

Tests that are currently failing and need attention.

| Test Suite | Status | Pass Rate | Priority | Issue |
|------------|--------|-----------|----------|--------|
| Paper Broker | 🔴 FAILING | 97/145 (66.9%) | HIGH | Cash/position update delegation |
| Security Policy | 🔴 FAILING | 0/16 (0%) | LOW | Service not implemented |
| Trading Calendar | 🔴 FAILING | 0/65 (0%) | LOW | Service not implemented |
| Alpaca Broker | 🔴 ERROR | N/A | MEDIUM | Mock setup issues |

## Test Execution Commands

### Run Critical Tests Only

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. pytest -m critical -v
```

### Run Important Tests

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. pytest -m important -v
```

### Run Smoke Tests

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. pytest tests/smoke/ -v
```

### Run Paper Trading Tests

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. pytest -m paper_trading -v
```

### Run All Tests (with failures allowed)

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. pytest tests/ -v || true
```

## CI/CD Pipeline Status

### Workflows

1. **ci-commit.yml** (On every push)
   - Timeout: 5 minutes
   - Runs: Critical tests, MyPy, Black
   - Must Pass: Yes

2. **ci-pull-request.yml** (On PR)
   - Timeout: 10 minutes
   - Runs: Critical + Important tests
   - Must Pass: Critical tests only

3. **ci-paper-trading.yml** (Scheduled)
   - Timeout: 15 minutes
   - Runs: Full integration tests with Alpaca
   - Must Pass: No (monitoring only)

## Known Issues

### High Priority

1. **PaperBroker Cash Updates** - Cash balance not updating after trades
   - Root Cause: Architecture follows clean separation - broker delegates to use cases
   - Fix: Implement portfolio management use cases

2. **Test Cancellation in CI** - Workflows occasionally timeout
   - Root Cause: 3-minute timeout too aggressive
   - Fix: Increased to 5 minutes

### Medium Priority

1. **Alpaca Broker Tests** - Mock setup failures
   - Root Cause: Missing mock configurations
   - Fix: Update mock fixtures

2. **Portfolio Thread Safety** - Concurrent access tests failing
   - Root Cause: Not implemented yet
   - Fix: Add locking mechanisms

### Low Priority

1. **Security Policy Service** - Not implemented
2. **Trading Calendar Service** - Not implemented
3. **Comparison operators** - Some edge cases in value objects

## Test Coverage

| Component | Coverage | Target |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Overall | 12% | 80% |
| Domain Layer | ~45% | 90% |
| Infrastructure | ~8% | 70% |
| Application | ~5% | 80% |

## Action Items

### Immediate (This Sprint)

- [x] Fix CI timeout issues
- [x] Add paper trading tests to CI
- [x] Categorize tests with markers
- [ ] Fix PaperBroker cash update issues
- [ ] Configure branch protection

### Next Sprint

- [ ] Implement portfolio management use cases
- [ ] Fix Alpaca broker mock issues
- [ ] Add thread safety to Portfolio
- [ ] Increase test coverage to 50%

### Future

- [ ] Implement SecurityPolicyService
- [ ] Implement TradingCalendar
- [ ] Achieve 80% test coverage
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks

## Test Marker Usage

Tests are marked with pytest markers for selective execution:

```python
@pytest.mark.critical  # Must pass for basic functionality
@pytest.mark.important  # Should pass for stable features
@pytest.mark.integration  # Requires external services
@pytest.mark.paper_trading  # Paper trading specific
@pytest.mark.slow  # Takes > 5 seconds
@pytest.mark.flaky  # Known to be unreliable
@pytest.mark.skip_ci  # Skip in CI environment
```

## Success Metrics

- **Critical Test Pass Rate**: 100% ✅
- **Important Test Pass Rate**: >95% ✅
- **Overall Test Pass Rate**: 50.4% 🟡
- **MyPy Errors**: 0 ✅
- **Code Coverage**: 12% 🔴

## Notes

1. The system architecture follows clean architecture principles with proper separation of concerns
2. PaperBroker delegates portfolio updates to use cases (not yet implemented)
3. Most domain layer tests are stable and passing
4. Infrastructure layer needs the most work
5. CI/CD pipeline is now properly configured for progressive testing
