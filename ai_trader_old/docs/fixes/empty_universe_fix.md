# Empty Universe Fix Summary

## Issue

The backfill was only processing 2 low-quality symbols (BRKHU, EGRVF) instead of the expected universe of 500+ stocks.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Missing quote_type values**: Out of 12,460 companies in the database, only 27 had quote_type set to 'EQUITY' or 'ETF'. The rest had NULL values.
2. **Missing current_price values**: Only 24 companies had current_price populated, and only 2 were in the configured range ($10-$500).
3. **Universe filters were too restrictive**: The combination of filters eliminated almost all stocks.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed quote_type Values

```sql
-- Set EQUITY for major exchanges
UPDATE companies
SET quote_type = 'EQUITY'
WHERE is_active = true
AND quote_type IS NULL
AND exchange IN ('AssetExchange.NYSE', 'AssetExchange.NASDAQ', 'AssetExchange.NYSEARCA', 'AssetExchange.BATS');

-- Set ETF for known ETFs
UPDATE companies
SET quote_type = 'ETF'
WHERE is_active = true
AND symbol IN ('SPY', 'QQQ', 'IWM', 'DIA', 'VTI', 'VOO', etc...);
```

Result: 8,834 EQUITY and 22 ETF symbols properly classified.

### 2. Updated Current Prices

```sql
WITH latest_prices AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT ON (symbol)
        symbol,
        close as current_price,
        timestamp
    FROM market_data
    WHERE interval = '1day'
    AND timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
    ORDER BY symbol, timestamp DESC
)
UPDATE companies c
SET
    current_price = lp.current_price,
    price_last_updated = lp.timestamp
FROM latest_prices lp
WHERE c.symbol = lp.symbol;
```

Result: 8,269 companies now have current prices, with 5,468 in the target range.

### 3. Fixed Module References

- Updated `populate_companies_table.py` to use `CompanyDataManager` instead of the old `IPODateManager`
- Added missing import for `sqlalchemy.text`

## Results

- Universe now contains 500 high-quality symbols
- Includes major stocks like TSLL, HIMS, INTC, CRWD, SOXX, BABA, etc.
- Proper filtering based on:
  - Min volume: $1M
  - Price range: $10-$500
  - Quote types: EQUITY and ETF only
  - Excludes: bankruptcy stocks (Q), warrants (W), foreign symbols (.)

## Best Practices Going Forward

1. Always verify that metadata columns (quote_type, current_price) are populated
2. Run `populate_companies_table.py` and price updates regularly
3. Monitor universe size before running backfills
4. Use debug scripts to troubleshoot filtering issues
