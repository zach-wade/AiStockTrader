# A10.5 Options Analytics Calculator - Architecture Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the architectural transformation of the monolithic `options_analytics.py` calculator into a modular, maintainable system of specialized calculators.

## Problem Statement

### Original Monolithic Structure

- **File Size**: 1,002 lines in a single file
- **Violations**: Single Responsibility Principle violations with multiple options analysis domains mixed together
- **Domains Mixed**: Volume/flow analysis, P/C ratios, IV analysis, Greeks, moneyness, unusual activity, sentiment, and Black-Scholes pricing
- **Dependencies**: Complex mathematical dependencies (scipy optimization, Black-Scholes models, statistical analysis)
- **Maintenance Issues**:
  - Hard to isolate and test individual options analysis domains
  - Changes to one options feature required understanding entire complex file
  - Adding new options features required modifying the monolithic structure

## Solution Architecture

### Modular Design Principles

The refactoring follows SOLID design principles with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each calculator handles one specific options analysis domain
2. **Open/Closed**: New calculators can be added without modifying existing ones
3. **Liskov Substitution**: All calculators implement consistent interfaces
4. **Interface Segregation**: Clients depend only on methods they use
5. **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules
