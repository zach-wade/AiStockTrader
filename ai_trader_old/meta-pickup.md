Start by erasing the current pickup.md file in the current working directory. Then create a new file in the current working directory called pickup.md which will help you pick up where you left off.

I’m going to clear this session, which means I’m going to wipe your memory, and then I’m going to start a new session.
When I start the new session, the pickup.md file is the only resource you’ll have to help you pick up where you left off.

So you need to write all the information to pickup.md that you will need to be able to pick up where you left off before I wiped your memory.

Don’t make any assumptions about what we’re going to work on next. So for example, don’t create a section called “Next Possible Steps” or anything that tries to predict what the user will ask of you. You’re not being asked to add planning information, you’re just being asked to preserve your memory.

Just provide yourself with the information in the pickup.md file you need to continue with whatever task the user asks of you once your memory is cleared.

Go ahead and create that file now, then I’m going to clear your memory, and then we’re going to load that file and continue working.
