"""Performance Calculator domain service for risk-adjusted performance metrics.

This module provides the PerformanceCalculator service which focuses specifically
on performance analysis and risk-adjusted return calculations. It handles Sharpe
ratio calculations and comprehensive risk-adjusted return analysis.

The service follows Single Responsibility Principle by focusing solely on performance
calculations, extracted from the original RiskCalculator to improve maintainability.

        """Calculate Sharpe ratio from returns.

        Computes the risk-adjusted return metric that measures excess return per
        unit of risk. The Sharpe ratio is the industry standard for comparing
        investment strategies on a risk-adjusted basis.

        Args:
            returns: List of period returns as decimals (e.g., 0.01 for 1%).
                Assumed to be daily returns. Requires at least MIN_DATA_POINTS_FOR_STATS
                values for statistical significance.
            risk_free_rate: Annual risk-free rate as decimal (default 0.02 for 2%).
                Typically the Treasury bill rate or similar benchmark.

        Returns:
            Decimal | None: Annualized Sharpe ratio. Returns None if:
                - Insufficient data points
                - Standard deviation is zero (no volatility)
                Higher values indicate better risk-adjusted returns.
                - < 0: Losing money relative to risk-free rate
                - 0-1: Positive but subpar risk-adjusted returns
                - 1-2: Good risk-adjusted returns
                - > 2: Excellent risk-adjusted returns

        Formula:
            Sharpe = (Annual Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Annual Volatility
            - Returns are annualized by multiplying by 252 (trading days)
            - Volatility is annualized by multiplying by âˆš252

        Note:
            The Sharpe ratio assumes returns are normally distributed, which may
            not hold for all trading strategies. Consider supplementing with other
            metrics like Sortino ratio for downside risk assessment.
